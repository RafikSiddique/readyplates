**The existing folder style is**
> lib > pages
## instead we can do
> lib > source/app > module(login/auth or home) see faiznikah on my repo for reference > typeoffile and folder required.

# I have changed the structure for reference in here too,

# What you can do now is, when you have a controller (and you should have a controller following MVC or MVVC or any architecture, they all have a part similar to controller just we call it by different name)
# So now you have login controller and service in the same folder so it's easy to track now.
